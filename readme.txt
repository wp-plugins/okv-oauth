Use OAuth such as Google to login and register.

== Description ==
Use Oauth such as Google account to login, register member in WordPress website. Control how your wp-login page will be used. Force use only OAuth or use them both.

If you want more secure to your account then you may needs "Multi-factor" authentication. But if you have many WordPress website on different server location (not multi-site WP) you must have too many of them in one authenticator app.

So, it is good idea to use OAuth instead because Google already use that.
